# Exercise set 1 - Database design

1. In this exercise you are going to use database design tools in MySQL Workbench application for designing a database according to given requirement of specification.
2. Database model should be returned to the return box in Moodle workspace in mwb file format (MySQL Workbench Document).

## Briefing
Design a database for the exhibitions where exhibitors can present their products for the visitors. Information related to different exhibitions should be stored to database. This streamlined database design aims to manage exhibitors, products and exhibitor booth locations in many exhibition areas (area A, area B etc.). Each exhibitor will have one show booth which is located in one of the exhibition areas. All exhibitions are always held in same location so location information is not required.

Exhibitors will register their unique IDs and provide essential details including company and contact information. Exhibitors will present products which should also be stored to the database. Each product will have a name, description and product category.

Exhibition visitors are uniquely identified by their name, organization and contact details. Visitors should also have an opportunity to give a review of the exhibition they attended using a five-star rating.


# My Grade
## 9.00/10.00

## Feedback
Your database model has most of the required information included, but exhibition itself is missing. Visitor shoudl review the exhibition, not particular exhibitor.
